# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders, delivery team, Sponsor, and key external stakeholders
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Product Manager leads, QA Specialist reviews for testability)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points, with team including Developers and QA Specialist)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) - include quality gates and acceptance testing requirements
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Establish team rhythm and ceremonies (Scrum Master facilitates if using agile methodology)

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
