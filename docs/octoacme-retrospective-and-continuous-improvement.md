# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Facilitated by: Scrum Master (or PM if no Scrum Master assigned)
- Participants: Core team (Developers, QA Specialist, PM, PdM) + External Stakeholders for major milestones
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Stakeholder Participation
- **Core team retrospectives**: After each sprint, all delivery team members participate
- **Extended retrospectives**: After major releases or milestones, invite External Stakeholders, Account Executives/Customer Success, and Sponsor to share feedback on collaboration, communication, and business outcomes

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
- Scrum Master tracks progress on action items and reports in sprint retrospectives
- Share improvement outcomes with External Stakeholders to demonstrate responsiveness to feedback
